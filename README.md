Github Issue Blog Reader, Based On [dva](https://github.com/dvajs/dva).

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/IssueReader/issue-reader-dva.git
cd issue-reader-dva
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Developing

### Built With

* [roadhog](https://github.com/sorrycc/roadhog) : Cli tool for creating react apps, configurable version of create-react-app.

* [dva](https://github.com/dvajs/dva) : React and redux based, lightweight and elm-style framework. (Inspired by elm and choo)

* [ant design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design) : A UI Design Language http://ant.design

* [ant design pro](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-pro) : An out-of-box UI solution for enterprise applications http://pro.ant.design/

* [Github OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/) : OAuth Apps use GitHub as an identity provider.

<!-- ### Prerequisites

1. 注册 leancloud 账号，创建应用

2. 安装 leancloud [命令行工具](https://leancloud.cn/docs/leanengine_cli.html)

3. [创建 Github OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/) -->

<!-- ### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here. -->

<!-- ### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags). -->


<!-- ## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project. -->

<!-- ## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
``` -->

<!-- ## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it. -->

<!-- ## Api Reference -->
<!-- If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters. -->

<!-- ## Database

[LeanStorage](https://leancloud.cn/docs/leanstorage_guide-js.html) -->
