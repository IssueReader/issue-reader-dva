## Developing

### Built With

* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) : Create React apps with no build configuration.

* [dva](https://github.com/dvajs/dva) : React and redux based, lightweight and elm-style framework. (Inspired by elm and choo)

* [ant design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design) : A UI Design Language http://ant.design

* [ant design pro](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-pro) : An out-of-box UI solution for enterprise applications http://pro.ant.design/

* [Github OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/) : OAuth Apps use GitHub as an identity provider.

* [Github GraphQL API v4](https://developer.github.com/v4/) : The GitHub GraphQL API v4 represents an architectural and conceptual shift from the GitHub REST API v3. You will likely encounter some new terminology in the GraphQL API v4 reference docs.

* [localForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage) : Offline storage, improved. Wraps IndexedDB, WebSQL, or localStorage using a simple but powerful API.


<!-- ### Prerequisites

1. 注册 leancloud 账号，创建应用

2. 安装 leancloud [命令行工具](https://leancloud.cn/docs/leanengine_cli.html)

3. [创建 Github OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/) -->

<!-- ### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here. -->

<!-- ### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags). -->


<!-- ## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project. -->

<!-- ## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
``` -->

<!-- ## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it. -->

<!-- ## Api Reference -->
<!-- If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters. -->

<!-- ## Database

[LeanStorage](https://leancloud.cn/docs/leanstorage_guide-js.html) -->
